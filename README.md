## Front End Architecture

I encourage some combination of OOCSS and BEM for these reasons:
+ It helps create clear, strict relationships between JS, CSS and HTML
+ It helps us create reusable, composable components
+ It allows for less nesting and lower specificity
+ It helps in building scalable stylesheets
